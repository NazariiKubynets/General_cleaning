					<h2 class="block-info__title">How Much Will Sanitation Cleaning Will Cost for You?</h2>
					<p>
						The price for commercial sanitation cleaning is between 
						$0.10 to $0.15 per square foot.  This equates to $50 to 
						$100 per hour. However, the price heavily depends on the 
						specific cleaning services required and the materials that 
						need to be cleaned. For example, cleaning windows can cost 
						more $8 per windowpane, and polishing floors can cost up to 
						$0.50 per square foot. <br><br>
						Commercially cleaning a bathroom typically costs around $100, 
						while a private office will set you back around $75. Some of 
						the costs for common commercial cleaning services per square 
						foot include: <br><br>
						Tile & Concrete Scrubbing - $0.12 to $0.25 <br>
						Carpet Cleaning - $0.08 - $0.25 <br>
						Stripping Floors - $0.3 - $0.5 <br>
